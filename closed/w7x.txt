Theory (Dr. Ralf Kleiber)
-------------------------------------------
* W7X: Who runs this?

* Woher kommt der Name?

* Der Stellarator
  - Grundsätzliche Idee
  - Vor/Nachteile bzgl. Tokamak
    (Hintergrund: die Hörer kennen Tokamaks schon)
    - Vorteil: kontinuierlicher Betrieb
    - Vorteil: kleiner Gefahr von Disruptionen
    - Nachteil: komplexerer Aufbau ??
  - Zentrale Herausforderungen
  
  - how do you calculate them?
    . The shape was calculated in the '80s. If one would use 
      today's computing power, would one get to the same result?
  
* The Model
  - What is the relationship between the model and the
    kinetic gas theory?
  - what exactly does the physical model of the plasma look like?
  - How exactly are the processes in the stellarator described by the model?
    . Are there many surprises?
    . What is the limits of what can be modeled?
  - What role do the Maxwell equations play in the model?
  
  
  
* Fusionsreaktionen
  - Which are suitable in principle for a stellarator?
  - Warum zwei? 
    . Hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium as starting elements
    . helium + neutrons + kin. Energy as products
  - What are the main differences between the 
    Plasma on the sun and a reactor on earth?
  - Comparison of energy density: fusion, nuclear fission, coal


* Design / layout of the form
  - What explains the shape of the magnets?


Experimental (Dr. Matthias Hirsch)
----------------------------------------

  - Gemeinsamkeiten mit Tokamak (durchsprechen)
    . "steam plant"
    . magnetic fields
    . plasma heating
    . Divertor
    . Tritim breeding
    . was noch?
    . size dependency -> the bigger the easier?


* instabilities
  - What are those?
  - How does the problem of plasma instability differ 
  from that of the Tokamak?
  - Is there a control loop in the stellarator that counteracts 
  the development of spontaneous plasma instability?

* Betrieb
  - What is actively controlled and monitored?
    - vac
    - cool
    - mag current
  - What "emergencies" are there, what rapid shutdown mechanisms?
  - "Cleaning?"
    (Energien, Pulsdauern, Temperaturen, Leistung)  

  - how do you put something like this into operation step by step?


* Konkrete Forschungsfragen  
  - demonstrate good confinement of the optimized magnetic field 
    and investigate particle transport under power plant-like conditions.
  - heat the plasma with effective heating methods
    . wie wird konkret geheizt?
    . cooling?
  - Develop methods to control the impurities/contamination of the plasma, 
    and the transport of the impurities.
  - reach beta values (ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic field pressure) 
    of 4 to 5 percent and analyze the beta limit
  - Demonstrate long-term or quasi-stationary operation
  - Investigating plasma replenishment, particle control and plasma-wall 
    interaction under continuous operating conditions
  - Conduct Divertor studies
  - Study, or utilization, of the bootstrap current

* P.S. ask the lovely folks at W7X how they’re going to deal with alpha
  particle confinement in stellarators ;)




* Status
  - In Betrieb?
  - Was sind die konkreten Ziele?
    . Burning Plasma? 
    . Net-Positive?
  - Vergleicht "Reifheit" mit ITER?

  - Erste Runde. Ziele? Erfolge?
  - Zweite Runde. Ziele? Erfolge?


* wall material
  - What part do neutrons play in the damage to the wall material?
  - Assuming that no great progress is made in materials research in relation 
    to wall material, how often would the material of a reactor of commercial 
    size have to be exchanged?

* What predictions, qualitative and quantitative, did the physical model 
  make before the experiment was put into operation?
  And which qualitative and quantitative deviations were detected and 
  measured in the first measurement runs?


* Herausforderungen beim Bau (FOrm!)
    
* Diagnose des Plamsa 
  - Was?
  - Wie?    


  - Since no fusionable plasma is produced in Greifswald, where exactly are 
    the limits of the experiment, what cannot be measured?
  - wie spielt das mit den anderen Fusionsreaktoren zusammen?

* Beyond Wendelstein
  - When the experiment is completed in Greifswald, and no larger
    surprises emerge, would it be technically feasible to build a reactor 
    with net energy output?
  - What is the prospect of a demonstration reactor of the type
    Stellarator? Both from the state of technical development, compared
    with the Tokamak, as well as from the "political" point of view?
  - Which are the largest physical or material-engineering
    Problems of stellarator research?
  - Other stellarators?
