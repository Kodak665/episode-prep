  where did names come from?
  
* Aircraft
  - RC-135S Cobra Ball
    . The Cobra Ball monitors missile-associated signals and 
      tracks missiles during boost and re-entry phases to provide 
      reconnaissance for treaty verification and theater ballistic 
      missile proliferation.
  - Sensors
    . Cameras mostly?
    . the "towel rails" suggest other kinds of sensors.
  - Ball/Eye Differences?
    . how different?
    . how many?
    . saw pics with the original low bypass 
      engines and with the R engines. Why?
    . Wing painted black
  - Crew structure in the back in the back
  - Quick overview over the other RC-135 variants

  - A bit of history on this mission 1960s

    . what if the weather is too bad to land?
  - Weather, and Landing Challenges
    . 70mph winds + fog
    . Short -> Precise

    . ILS?
    . support from ground

    . wind shear - how do you know?
