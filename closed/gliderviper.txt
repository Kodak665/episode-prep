  - what did they tell you regarding g and getting sick?
    "Air sickness is not characterized as a valid cause"

* did you get sick? 
  - almost
  - tired!
  
* Highlights: 
  - During the exercise, our plane has been shot down by a virtual missile ...
  - ... then fast climb to intercept
  - now chooses a full afterburner and the large turbofan engine ... 
  - On the other hand, there is time for us in tight formation to go down to 300 ft ...
    The aircraft's manual says that you must fly a minimum of 700 km / h at low 
    altitude to have energy in the event of an engine stop.
  - supersonic!
  
* Added benefit, got to fly over "your" country.  
  - beautiful view
  - We have perfect weather", ie. 3/8 CU at 4000 ft and at least 100 km visibility.

* I was behind the airplane, were you too?

* what did you learn about flying the f-16 (some of these are mine.)
  - auto rudder
  - light aileron, heavy elevator
  - rather quiet
  - accel during take off never ends
  - 3D!
  - reduce power -> almost like an airbrake
    We have slowed down from 700 km / h to 400 km / h in quite a few seconds.
  
* bath in the fire pond

* It took me many days to interpret and process the flight as well as to 
  get down from this excitement and adrenaline rush.  
  That experience surpassed even my wildest imagination.
