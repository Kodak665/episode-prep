* Context: ATLAS
  - context LHC
  - what is it
    . magnet
    . different detectors
  - what does it measure
    . bending, speed, energy, momentum
  - what is the data that comes out directly
  
* Clean up
  - Structure of the data you get as a scientist
    . particles + energies + momenta
    . abstract from how the detector works
  - what does the ATLAS team do to prepare the data for you
    . self calibration
    . identify the detector DoF => model, parameters
  - DoF in Science (loops)
    
* The Model (simulation)
  - why?
  - fitting
  - the role of histograms    
    
* What do you want to achieve
  - Example!
  - what is the kind of code you write?
  - filtering
  - summing
  - rejecting
  - histogramming

* Tools and languages
  - root
  - c++
  - DSLs :-)
    
* what exactly are you working on these days?
