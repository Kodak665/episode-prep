* Intro Hal

* Skunk Works!
 
* Describe the aircraft (I assume everyone has seen it)
  - very very delta
  - v tail
  - two engines
  - faceted

* Brief history of stealth
  - wasn't invented by Skunk Works, was it?
  - I think I remember something about Russia?
  - https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBB_Lampyridae
  
* What was the timeline
  - start of dev
  - flight testing
  - intro to service
  - end   

* Which components were taken from other airplanes?
  - FBW F-16
  - No chance it would continue flying w/o computers (like F-16)


* Where did the name come from?
  - why F and not B?
  - why 117?
  - when did "Nighthawk" come up? I think that was not an initial name, was it?
 


* Secrecy during development, test, and early ops
  - procedures, cover-stories and facilitites 
  - initial pictures that made the sweep look less
  - night flying
  - "satellite evasion"?
  - ATC?
  - Area 51
  - Groom Lake
  - Did you guys laugh about all the silly rumors?
    F-19? UFOs?
  - wobbly gobblin


* Development History
  - Senior Trend
  - Have Blue
  - What else?

* Stealth Testing
  - the pole 
    . operators thought the system was broken b/c nothing visible
    . ... then a bird landed on it, and it lit up
    . did this actually happen :-) ?
  - in the air?
  - air-to-air?
  - stealthiness from all directions? also above?
  - how much smaller was the RCS?
    . compare to something f-16 or whatever?
    . doesn't have to be zero to be useful

* Do we know something about the relative stealthiness of the 
  F-117, B-2, F-22 and F-35? 
  
* Radar reflectors for flying in "normal" airspace?  
  
    
* Did you ever try any air-to-air (dog) fighting?
  - never carried a2a weapons, right?

* The flight control system
  - taken from F-16?
  - "Reprogrammed"?
  - Different (degradation) laws, like the Airbus?
  
* Missions
  - pre-planning vs. "improvisation"?
  - How much was automated, did the pilot do much?
  - More like flying an airliner?
  
* Flight Characteristics
  - it's one thing to add artificial stability through a FBW system,
  - but you can't FBW-away turbulence and stuff from a "bad" shape.
  - How did it handle? 
    . speeds
    . AoA range
    . "agility"?
  - Were there unpleasant corners of the envelope?
  - Was it efficient (power to speed or something? probably not very)

* How did the design balance RCS vs. flight characteristics? 
  - Was it really a compromise?
  - To some degree it was, otherwise they'd just build a sphere.
  - what other constraints on the design?
    - engine inlet grids
    - flat exhausts
    - how did this affect engine cooling?
    - enough air? What about engine stalls?

* How did the other low observability characteristics (grids on intakes,
  flat exhausts) affect the flight characteristics?

* First flight(s)
  - how much simulation before the first flight
    CFD, Wind Tunnel, Sim
  - single seater: was there a sim for you to familiarize yourself with the a/c?
  - talk about the first flight.
  - Envelope expansion
  - At what point was testing handed over to the AF?
  - What was your involvement after handover?
  - was the test programme more expansive because the a/c was so 
    different from past experience?
  - timeline
  - surprises?

* How did you get to be the person to test this airplane?    
  - background/experience
  
* Weapons Sensors
  - FLIR, DLIR
  - Self-designation vs. 3rd party?
  - Weapons: basically LGBs, right?
  
* Rumors of recent use?  
  
* What did you do after your F-117 time?
  
* Missions
  - (I think) Panama
  - 1990s Gulf War
  - what else is publicly known?
  - did it ever fly during daylight?
  - I think one was shot down above Bosnia. 
    What do we know about this?
    How/why did Stealth "fail"?
