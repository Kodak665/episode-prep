The thing is really like to know is what it was like just to hand fly. What was it like to just fly around; heavy, nimble, responsive, what was it like when you opened the throttle and climbed? I guess; was it fun to fly?



---------- HAL ------------------------

* Introduction Hal Farley

* a bit about your career
  - Lockheed test pilot, not AF
  - buf AF history?
  - did you go through the TPS?
  - Grumman before. F-14
  

--------- The airplane ---------------

* Developed by Skunk Works!
  - a bit about the Skunk Works
  - under Ben Rich, not Kelly Johnson

* Describe the aircraft (I assume everyone has seen it)
  - very very delta
  - V tail
  - two engines (F404, like F-18)
  - faceted
  - Size ca. like an F-15

* how did you react when you saw it first :-) ?

* what was the cockpit like? 
  - Steam Gauges or screens?
  - I think I have seen both?


* Brief history of stealth
  - Russia: Pyotr Ufimtsev
  - wasn't invented by Skunk Works, was it? 
  - But: Denys Overholser
  - https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBB_Lampyridae
  - trick 1: deflect away
    . no 90 degrees ("cats eyes")
    . leading edge > 50 deg
  - trick 2: absorb
  - works for monostatic radars; 
    Passive (multistatic) radar, bistatic radar and especially multistatic 
    radar systems can detect stealth aircraft

* Which components were taken from other airplanes?
  - FBW F-16
    . But it has a "real" stick :-)
    . "Reprogrammed"?
    . Does it have (degradation) laws in case of partial failures, 
      like the Airbus?
  - what other components have been "stolen"?
  
* Development History
  - hopeless diamond
  - Senior Trend
  - Have Blue
  - What else?

* Where did the name come from?
  - why F and not B?
  - why 117?
  - when did "Nighthawk" come up? 
    I think that was not an initial name, was it?
 
 
--------- Flight Testing ---------------

* What was the timeline
  - start of dev in the 70s
  - 81 flight testing
  - 83 intro to service
  - 2008 End of Service

* How did you become "first flight" pilot?
  - background/experience
  - There were colleagues in your team, right? 
    Morgenstern, Ferguson

    
* Secrecy during development, test, and early ops
  - initial pictures that made the sweep look less
  - procedures, cover-stories and facilitites 
    . At Area 51, Groom Lake. 
    . did testing happen at night?
    . "satellite evasion"?
    . What did you tell ATC?
  - Did you guys laugh about all the silly rumors?
    F-19? UFOs?

* How did the design balance RCS vs. flight characteristics? 
  - Was it really a compromise?
    . To some degree it was, otherwise they'd just build a sphere.
  -  what other constraints on the design beyond shape?
    . engine inlet grids: enough air? What about engine stalls?
    . flat exhausts: how did this affect engine cooling?


* Stealth Testing
  - The pole 
    . operators thought the system was broken b/c nothing visible
    . ... then a bird landed on it, and it lit up
    . did this actually happen :-) ?
  - stealthiness from all directions? also above?
  - In-flight testing
    . ground to air?
    . air-to-air?
  - how much smaller was the RCS?
    . compare to something F-16 or whatever?
    . doesn't have to be zero to be useful
    
* First flight
  - How much simulation before the first flight
    CFD, Wind Tunnel, Sim
  - single seater: was there a sim for you to familiarize yourself with the a/c?
  - talk about the first flight.
    . take-off w/o ADC, bit lead in nose 
    . yawing problem -> turn on ADC earlier
    . fins too small -> 50% bigger fins
    . tailpipe overheat -> 15 minutes flight
    . canopy open light
  - visibility in cockpit?  

* Flight Characteristics
  - unstable pitch + yaw
  - it's one thing to add artificial stability through a FBW system,
    . but you can't FBW-away turbulence and stuff from a "bad" shape.
  - How did it handle? 
    . speeds
    . AoA range
    . "agility"?
  - Were there unpleasant corners of the envelope?
  - Was it efficient (power to speed or something? probably not very)
  - tuned: feels like a normal airplane
  - Where did the name Wobbly Gobblin come from?
  - And Stinkbug :-) ?
  - How did the other low observability characteristics (grids on intakes,
    flat exhausts) affect the flight characteristics?


* Flight Testing
  - Envelope expansion steps
  - cooperation in testing between company and air force
  - At what point was testing handed over to the AF?
  - What was your involvement after handover?
  - was the test programme more expansive because the a/c was so 
    different from past experience?

* Do we know something about the relative stealthiness of the 
  F-117, B-2, F-22 and F-35? 
  
* Radar reflectors for flying in "normal" airspace?  
  
* Did you ever even try any air-to-air (dog) fighting?
  - never carried a2a weapons, right?


------------- MISSIONS ---------------------------

* Weapons/Sensors
  - Nav: GPS + Inertial
  - FLIR, DLIR, no radar
  - Self-designation vs. 3rd party?
  - Weapons: basically LGBs, right?
 
  
* Operational flying from Tonopah, later Holloman
  - what prompted the move?
  
* Missions
  - typical profile?
  - Air refuelling critical for missions, right?
  - pre-planning vs. "improvisation"?
  - How much was automated, did the pilot do much?
  - More like flying an airliner?
  
* Operational Use
  - (I think) Panama
  - 1990s Gulf War
  - what else is publicly known?
  - did it ever fly during daylight?
  - One was shot down above Bosnia. 
    . What do we know about this?
    . How/why did Stealth "fail"?
 
  
------------- OUTRO ---------------------------

* Rumors of recent use?  

* What did you do after your F-117 time? 
  - F-22 & F-35 first flight by others?
  - but you did fly them, right?

* Flying/testing the F--17 important. But Was it fun? 
  - Is the aircraft fun to fly?
  - Looking back, what airplane did you enjoy most?
