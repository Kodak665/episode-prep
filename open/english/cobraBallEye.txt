* Introduction Robert

* Mission Overview
  - Understanding the development and evolution of missiles and reentry
    vehicles of the Soviet Union, and 
  - understanding their compliance with SALT II
  - Observation from aircraft Ball/Eye
  - plus ground-based and ship-based radars (Dane, Judy)

* Aircraft
  - RC-135S Cobra Ball
    . The Cobra Ball monitors missile-associated signals and 
      tracks missiles during boost and re-entry phases to provide 
      reconnaissance for treaty verification and theater ballistic 
      missile proliferation.
  - Sensors
    . Cameras mostly?
    . the "towel rails" suggest other kinds of sensors.
  - Ball/Eye Differences?
    . how different?
    . saw pics with the original low bypass 
      engines and with the R engines. Why?
    . Wing painted black
  - Crew structure in the back in the back
  - Quick overview over the other RC-135 variants

* Mission
  - Alerting - how much warning?
    . what was the trigger for the launch?
      How did you know that "something was coming"?
    . what happens then? Mission Walkthrough.
    . radio silence?
  - Where was the collecting area, how long to get there from Shemya
  - How you know when exactly to be where to record the reentry?
  - Mission Timing and Precision ("feet and seconds") - why?
  - What exactly is the goal? Size? Shape? Speed? Location?
  - Tuna patrols.
  - How long were the missions?
  - Why two Navs 
  - Refuelling?
  - A bit of history on this mission 1960s

  - Today? Satellites?
  
* Shemya
  - Where? Aleutian Islands
    Island twice as long as rwy :-)
  - A/c rotation into/out of Shemya <-> Eielson
    . route
    . refuelling
    . what if the weather is too bad to land?
  - Weather, and Landing Challenges
    . 70mph winds + fog
    . What did you do when the weather was bad at Shemya
      when you returned from a mission?
    . wind shear - how do you know?
    . ILS?
    . Short -> Precise
    . "Navy arrival" instead of soft landing :-)
  - Crew selection
  - Life there
    . grocery shopping
    . what do you do there?
    . supply flights?
  - Practice/Flight Training
