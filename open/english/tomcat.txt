  - Was the F-18 or the F-14 the better dog fighter?

--------------

* History
  - development timeline
  - which other countries considered the F-14?
    it woudl have been a good fit for the UK, Nick Anderson said.
  - What prompted the retirement?
    just too expensive?
    or did the requirements change to favour the F-18? 
  - From Tomcat to Bombcat
    . As the F14 took more of an attack role, did they upgrade the radar?  
  - TARPS
  - Why did the USAF not use the F14 (or more air forces for that matter). 
  - There seems no real replacement for the F-14/AIM-54 combination. 
    So could you argue, that the F-14 in its pure Fleet Defender role would
    still be superior to the F-18 ? 
  - Why is this aircraft so much of a cult? Is it really because of Top Gun?
