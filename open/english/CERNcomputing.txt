* Quick recap of the overall process
  - detectors and subdetectors
  - data storage
  - data analysis

* Where do we need computing
  - trigger
  - recording
  - reduktion
  - analysis
  - simulation

* Trigger
  - fast!
    how stored?
  - lots of hardware computations (FPGAs etc)
  - and dedicated detectors
  - "analog processing", eg, optical summing

* Recording
  - lots of fast hard disks
  - discuss the storage systems
  
* Reduction
  - what is done?
    . taking into account the detector's intricacies
    . from lots of measured hits to particles
    . ... to origin momentum vectors
  - starts to become more computationally intensive
  - where does this happen? At CERN or outside?
  
* CERN Grid
  - explain the structure
  - where do you get the connections from? YOu don't dig.  
    
* Analysis
  - ... mostly on the machines of institutes?
  
* Simulation
  - Monte Carlo
  - GEANT 4
  - Physics Sim
  - vs. Detector Sim
