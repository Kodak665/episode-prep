mention the idaflieg talk
refer to concordia ep

you experience 
not that much glider
28 meter

- What is Nixus
- Who owns/financed it? Why? History?
  rest of the team?
  dagfinn gangsaas fbw
  jack payne test pilot (perlan)
  Loek Boermans
- Fuselage of the 30/32
  
- thinner wing 
  good for aerodynamics
  but also possible bc of fbw
- wingspan?
- fbw system - why?
- fbw controls what?
- discrete flap settings or continuous
- based on which inputs/parameters?
- high aspect ratio wing -> mechnaical challanges?
- how are the airfoils designed? how are they different? yours or loeks?
  turbulators
- why no bends :-) ?
- why not add the fbw to existing wings, was there also "wing innovation"? which?
- why the ash 30?
- mechanical backup?
- lift plateau in the polar - how do you design this?
- aspect ratio 53 - how to get it stiff? - eta 52, concordia 57
- prepregs in the wing. What is this? why? challenge?

- experience, performance?  

- reduction of adverse yaw
- custom control laws - less rudder. 
- why not do the other surfaces with fbw?

- fist glider with fbw
- focus on record flights -> why?
- expect better perf b/c of fbw flaps?


- what is the max wing loading?
  optimized for great weather?

- non-linear elastic vortex lattice method
- why two seater
- iterative airfoil design - what do you optimize for?
- designing a flapped profile - which airfoil do you optimize?
  high speed, high lift?
  what flight profile / weather model did you use? -> v3 design
- fbw lets you go thin -> good for high speed, then flaps for high lift?
- prepregs: what other tricks to build sctructure?
- relationship to x-57; material data
- wing much thinner than traditional -> see inner wing shape :-)
- what was first: thing wing -> fbw or fbw -> thin wing
- automatic fem model generation?
- 2 seater + motor -> heacy fuselage -> bending moment on wing 950kg w/o water
- high strength fibers -> challenge beyond price? stiffness & tensile strength

- how long to design and build
- build autoklave, molds
- 183 schichten Kohle. Precision to get strenght?

- load test. how did you do it? what happend? why? analysis? cad? build?
  rebuild. Flex of 16ft
  
- why fbw. flap optimization. Avoid mixer. Chamge in flight!  
  load alleviation, flutter supp, accessibility, 
- architecture, redundancy. 3 comp, 3 bus. acutator red?	
  actuators, sensors. which computers. 
- still 1 mech aileron
- which prog lang, hardware. Servos. Servo Temperature. Cabling? Connectors!
- wnich is simpler? mech mxier? fbw?
- certificated how?
- experimental not in cs22. Wing loading too high, stall speed too high
  what is approach speed?
  
  
- preliminary eval of the idea? Experiences? Performance? Handling?
- what about force feedback?
  rolls nicely, no stall surprises
how many hours?
whats state of testing? vne limite?
role of exiting models now in flight test?

fbw in production airplanes
prepregs what is benefit of prepregs?

what are the optimization goals?

how did you get the idea? auto drive for flap handle in sergios ash 30

how is mech mixed with fbw
tehre's still a flap handle, right?

what bus?
what more safety designs? segmented flap vs. fbw?

what laws? vgl airbus
ever had a failure? How to land with failed?
  
  
did some one already accuse of taking the pilot skill out of flying?

- Other projects you've designed

what did you learn, what would you do differntly in the your next one?
