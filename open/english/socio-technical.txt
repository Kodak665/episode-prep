Overview
---------------------------------

* What is a socio-technical system

* Complexity and Adaptivity
  - Emergence?
  - the comparison to ant colonies

* Central control vs. decentralization
  - many local, reactive entities w/o centralized control

* Definition(s) of complexity
  - different perspectives
    different roles (e.g. owners, customers)
  - nobody understands everything and controls it

* Def of intractability: 
  - can't "jump" into the future, you have to go there

* The grid as an example
  - a way of approaching: self-regulating, the 50Hz, the dampfventil

* Are markets the solution?

* The problem sustainability
  - of the socia-technical thing as a beast: eats and poops
  - why did the system evolve to this point where it isn't sustainable?
  - "control" a complex process to not self-unsustain itself

* You seem to work a lot on energy, climate and the grid. Why?


What exactly then is the research question?
--------------------------------------
* Semantic web

* Agents
  - how do you know which basic rules to give to them
    or which space of rules

* How do you know what to include
  - perspectives
  - resources
  - rules

* What kinds of rules and formlisms?
  - if-then-else?
  - state machines?
  - linear equations?
  - what else? DGLs?
  
* Problem of the unknown unknowns

* Simulation
  - then look at patterns.  
  - how do you know when to stop running it?
  - sensitivity analysis, parameter variation

* What is milti-modeling?


* Examples. 
  - CO2 trading
  - why specifically the energy sector as an area of focus?
  - what else are examples of successful use?
  - how do you define success of one of your projects?

  
  
Insights
---------------------------------------  
* Insights: how do you grow a sustainable socio-technical system

* Bottom up 
  - how do you define the "botton up" rules?

* Fail gracefully  
  - meaning? many small experiments?
  - vs. resilience?

* Grow 
  - step by step
  - it might become sustainable, but slow?
  
* Together
  - ?

* What does this mean for collective rule making in governments? 
  - where we try to centralize some decisions?
  - are those systems too complex to be "governed"?
  - should we simplify?
  - Relationship to Tainter

* Is evolution a little bit like machine learning? 
  In the sense that even though it is supposed to be 
  neutral and objective it depends on the rules 
  (data) we use for evolving (learning)?

* Relationship to technikfolgenabsch√§tzung?
