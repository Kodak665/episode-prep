Part 1: Intro and background
-----------
* A preamble 
  - There will be a lots of overloaded language.
  - Complexity etc is popularly known from a physics / mathematical / network 
    science perspective, Santa Fe institute style. Social science perspectives 
    are far less well known
  - A fundamental challenge all social sciences face is "the incoherency problem": 
    lack of a single fundamental and consistent ontology, like laws of nature. We 
    will be talking about social systems, which are socially constructed, self 
    referential and subjectively interpreted and experienced and most of the 
    listeners of OmegaTau podcast seem to be engineering and natural sciences 
    oriented, many instincts might not work.

* What is a socio-technical system
  - We do call it socio-tech, but what we really mean is 
         bio-geo-chemical-socio-technical systems.
    Humans and their technology, coevolving with the ecosystems within a 
    chemical and geological cycles of the planet. Socio-tech means that we focus 
    on the humans and their co-evolution with technology. Steven Pinkers wonderful 
    paper "The cognitive niche: Coevolution of intelligence, sociality, and 
    language" poses the situation wonderfully: 
    . Natural world gives rise to the mind 
    . Mind creates language based on its own physical nature
    . Mind creates language and language creates culture 
    . culture is technology and changes the physical world 
    . changes the mind and language... 
    An autocatalytic/ autopeietic system:

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocatalysis

  - Socio-technical system is not just Social + Technical system
    - Diverse nature of interactions
    - Topology/structure of interactions
    - Dynamics within the structure
    - Evolution / change of the structure of interactions

* Stakeholders / decision makers
    - Multi-actor systems 
    - Not a single individual/organization controls/determines
    - Constant interactions
    - Multitude of perspectives
    - Ownership
    - Legislation, and applicability of it to a specific party
    - Beliefs, habits, norms, values, preferences, irrationality, cognitive biases etc 

* Simplicity, Complicatedness and  Complexity 
  - Two types of simplicty: Functional and structural. Socio-Tech is mainly about 
    functional simplicity. "Civilization advances by extending the number of 
    important operations which we can perform without thinking about them." 
                                          -Alfred North Whitehead, 1911
                                          
  - Complicatedness: most technical systems. Many, many things that fit together 
    exactly one way. 
    . Very efficient
    . can be engineered with a reductionist approach
    . but fragile and really hard to understand.
  - Complexity: systems that exhibit 
    . emergent properties
    . self-organize
    . adapt/learn
    . have functional hierarchies. 
    . through endless interactions of heterogeneous elements. 
    Often "easy" to understand, very hard if not impossible to 
    engineer. e.g. Linux kernel vs cell genome : 
    https://www.wired.com/2010/05/linux-vs-life/  
    and https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/05/29/0903206106.abstract

* Definition(s) of complexity / CAS
  - D.C. Mikulecky, : Complexity as an inability of any one formal 
    description being adequate to capture all relevant system properties.
  - Kauffman CAS definition
  - different perspectives
    different roles (e.g. owners, customers)
  - nobody understands everything and controls it

* Emergence and self organization
  - Patterns, their generation and our understanding
    . We are pattern creators and pattern-matchers. 
    . When does a novel pattern arise / is understood?
  - Emergence
    . process of creation of patterns, that are more easily 
      understood in their own right. 
    . it "does not exists per se its just systems doing what they do"
  - the comparison to ant colonies, consciousness, ecosystems, 
    societies, etc. “It emergence all the way up”

* The key problem : Human civilization has emerged into a unsustainable state.
  - of the socio-technical thing as a beast: eats and poops
  - define unsustainable
  - why did the system evolve to this point where it isn't sustainable?
  - Why is the ultimate question. I hypothesize that it is the simples and most 
    effective way to use energy is fossil. It is a necessary stage of development. 
    Coupled with a hyper-efficient short term optimisation of anglo-saxon 
    style of shareholder capitalism that exploits basic human drives such as fear, 
    greed, sex etc. Humans have  developed exponentially. Great success, but 
    it is not coupled to the natural systems time scales. 
    The challange is to manage the metabolisms speed 
  - "control" a complex process to not self-unsustain itself. 
	. Control is entirely the wrong way to think about it. 
	. (Which is why I put it in quotes :-))
	. it shaping the evolution of something that is many orders of magnitude 
	  larger than an individual. The sustainability challenges we are facing 
	  are unprecedented in their scale and complexity.  We have to actively 
	  evolve (into) a less unsustainable state by engineering, gardening, 
	  governing, marketing and believing ourselves into it. 
	. This requires a shared situational awareness at a societal scale, allowing 
	  for conflicting rationalities, diversity of norms and values and 
	  multitude of futures visions.
    . But then how do we know we are on the right track?


* Central control vs. decentralization as a way out?
  - decentral control vs self-organization.
  - Humans love centralised control, because it works well to reduce the  amount 
    of choice. Niklas Luhman, autopoiesis. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann 
  - many local, reactive entities w/o centralized control
  - It is all about people, very often individuals or very small groups that 
    make decisions that impact the world. most of the time it is done with very 
    little clue, and under very narrow sets of considerations
  - Models and simulations offer a way to help this
 
* The grid as an example
  - a way of approaching: self-regulating, the 50Hz, the dampfventil

* Are markets the solution?

* You seem to work a lot on energy, climate and the grid. Why?
  - Infra part of infrastructure is key. Is the the thing that is "under" eveything. 
    It is the big, slow, boring stuff that nobody wants to talk about, but 
    absolutely everything depends on it.

* What exactly then is the research question?
  - How to we shape, steer and garden socio-technical systems towards 
    sustainability? By providing  solid, scientific  model-based decision 
    support to stakeholders when taking discrete decision that have very 
    large and long term impacts on the world.

Part 2: Modelling and tools
-----------

* Semantic web

* Agents
  - how do you know which basic rules to give to them
    or which space of rules

* How do you know what to include
  - perspectives
  - resources
  - rules

* What kinds of rules and formlisms?
  - if-then-else?
  - state machines?
  - linear equations?
  - what else? DGLs?
  
* Def of intractability: 
  - can't "jump" into the future, you have to go there  
  
* Simulation
  - then look at patterns.  
  - how do you know when to stop running it?
  - sensitivity analysis, parameter variation

* How do you know a simulation is
  - correct
  - reliable/trustworthy to X%
  - is there any notion of "proof"?
  - Problem of the unknown unknowns

 
* What is milti-modeling?

* Examples. 
  - CO2 trading
  - why specifically the energy sector as an area of focus?
  - what else are examples of successful use?
  - how do you define success of one of your projects?

Part 3: Insights
-----------

* Insights: how do you grow a sustainable socio-technical system

* Bottom up 
  - how do you define the "botton up" rules?

* Fail gracefully  
  - meaning? many small experiments?
  - vs. resilience?

* Grow 
  - step by step
  - it might become sustainable, but slow?
  
* Together
  - ?

* What does this mean for collective rule making in governments? 
  - where we try to centralize some decisions?
  - are those systems too complex to be "governed"?
  - should we simplify?
  - Relationship to Tainter

* Is evolution a little bit like machine learning? 
  In the sense that even though it is supposed to be 
  neutral and objective it depends on the rules 
  (data) we use for evolving (learning)?

* Relationship to technikfolgenabschätzung?
