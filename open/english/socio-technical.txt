Part 1: Intro and background
-----------
* A preamble 
  - There will be a lots of overloaded language.
  - Complexity etc is popularly known from a physics / mathematical / network 
    science perspective, Santa Fe institute style. Social science perspectives 
    are far less well known
  - A fundamental challenge all social sciences face is "the incoherency problem": 
    lack of a single fundamental and consistent ontology, like laws of nature. We 
    will be talking about social systems, which are socially constructed, self 
    referential and subjectively interpreted and experienced and most of the 
    listeners of OmegaTau podcast seem to be engineering and natural sciences 
    oriented, many instincts might not work.

* What is a socio-technical system
  - We do call it socio-tech, but what we really mean is 
         bio-geo-chemical-socio-technical systems.
    Humans and their technology, coevolving with the ecosystems within a 
    chemical and geological cycles of the planet. Socio-tech means that we focus 
    on the humans and their co-evolution with technology. Steven Pinkers wonderful 
    paper "The cognitive niche: Coevolution of intelligence, sociality, and 
    language" poses the situation wonderfully: 
    . Natural world gives rise to the mind 
    . Mind creates language based on its own physical nature
    . Mind creates language and language creates culture 
    . culture is technology and changes the physical world 
    . changes the mind and language... 
    An autocatalytic/ autopeietic system: 
    http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/05/04/0914630107  
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocatalysis

  - Socio-technical system is not just Social + Technical system
    - Diverse nature of interactions
    - Topology/structure of interactions
    - Dynamics within the structure
    - Evolution / change of the structure of interactions

* Stakeholders / decision makers
    - Multi-actor systems 
    - Not a single individual/organization controls/determines
    - Constant interactions
    - Multitude of perspectives
    - Ownership
    - Legislation, and applicability of it to a specific party
    - Beliefs, habits, norms, values, preferences, irrationality, cognitive biases etc 

* Simplicity, Complicatedness and  Complexity 
  - Two types of simplicty: Functional and structural. Socio-Tech is mainly about 
    functional simplicity. "Civilization advances by extending the number of 
    important operations which we can perform without thinking about them." 
                                          -Alfred North Whitehead, 1911
                                          
  - Complicatedness: most technical systems. Many, many things that fit together 
    exactly one way. 
    . Very efficient
    . can be engineered with a reductionist approach
    . but fragile and really hard to understand.
  - Complexity: systems that exhibit 
    . emergent properties
    . self-organize
    . adapt/learn
    . have functional hierarchies. 
    . through endless interactions of heterogeneous elements. 
    Often "easy" to understand, very hard if not impossible to 
    engineer. e.g. Linux kernel vs cell genome : 
    https://www.wired.com/2010/05/linux-vs-life/  
    and https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/05/29/0903206106.abstract

* Definition(s) of complexity / CAS
  - D.C. Mikulecky, : Complexity as an inability of any one formal 
    description being adequate to capture all relevant system properties.
  - Kauffman CAS definition
  - different perspectives
    different roles (e.g. owners, customers)
  - nobody understands everything and controls it

* Emergence and self organization
  - Patterns, their generation and our understanding
    . We are pattern creators and pattern-matchers. 
    . When does a novel pattern arise / is understood?
  - Emergence
    . process of creation of patterns, that are more easily 
      understood in their own right. 
    . it "does not exists per se its just systems doing what they do"
  - the comparison to ant colonies, consciousness, ecosystems, 
    societies, etc. “It emergence all the way up”  
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaGEjrADGPA 


* The key problem : Human civilization has emerged into a unsustainable state.
  - of the socio-technical thing as a beast: eats and poops
  - define unsustainable
  - why did the system evolve to this point where it isn't sustainable?
  - Why is the ultimate question. I hypothesize that it is the simples and most 
    effective way to use energy is fossil. It is a necessary stage of development. 
    Coupled with a hyper-efficient short term optimisation of anglo-saxon 
    style of shareholder capitalism that exploits basic human drives such as fear, 
    greed, sex etc. Humans have  developed exponentially. Great success, but 
    it is not coupled to the natural systems time scales. 
    The challange is to manage the metabolisms speed 
  - "control" a complex process to not self-unsustain itself. 
	. Control is entirely the wrong way to think about it. 
	. (Which is why I put it in quotes :-))
	. it shaping the evolution of something that is many orders of magnitude 
	  larger than an individual. The sustainability challenges we are facing 
	  are unprecedented in their scale and complexity.  We have to actively 
	  evolve (into) a less unsustainable state by engineering, gardening, 
	  governing, marketing and believing ourselves into it. 
	. This requires a shared situational awareness at a societal scale, allowing 
	  for conflicting rationalities, diversity of norms and values and 
	  multitude of futures visions.
    . But then how do we know we are on the right track?


* Central control vs. decentralization as a way out?
  - decentral control vs self-organization.
  - Humans love centralised control, because it works well to reduce the  amount 
    of choice. Niklas Luhman, autopoiesis. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann 
  - many local, reactive entities w/o centralized control
  - It is all about people, very often individuals or very small groups that 
    make decisions that impact the world. most of the time it is done with very 
    little clue, and under very narrow sets of considerations
  - Models and simulations offer a way to help this
 
* The grid as an example
  - a way of approaching: self-regulating, the 50Hz, the dampfventil
  

* Are markets the solution?
- Markets are "societal technology" They  ae not a natural phenomenon. Like all technology, sometimes they work, and sometimes they fail spectacularly.
- especially when they are tied to large interests that lobbies the governments, like healthcare in the US.
- markets are often the problem, as ideology dominates reality. E.g. see excessive privatisation "because makets are awesome" in  infrastructures where natural monopolies exists, e.g. train network in the UK.
- Markets have to be designed to match the physical aspects of the system, and the desired goal. Sometimes we get the market right, more often we get them wrong. See CO2 market.
- Energy only markets ( where there is no way to pay for energy storage) can not deliver 100% renewables, see our upcoming paper Kraan et al. 

* You seem to work a lot on energy, climate and the grid. Why?
  - Infra part of infrastructure is key. Is the the thing that is "under" eveything. 
    It is the big, slow, boring stuff that nobody wants to talk about, but 
    absolutely everything depends on it.
    - Very lage path dependency, and thus very large effect on future.

* What exactly then is the research question?
  - How to we shape, steer and garden socio-technical systems towards 
    sustainability? By providing  solid, scientific  model-based decision 
    support to stakeholders when taking discrete decision that have very 
    large and long term impacts on the world.
   - What is the role of models in paticipative decision making proceses? And how can "qunantitative story telling" help us reach the necessary tough decision to get a more sustainable world?

Part 2: Modelling and tools
-----------
Preamble : We are in a very different world of modelling that  natual and technical sciences. Models there are about using first principles to derive prerdictions about the world that can be verified expeimentally. In our world, wher thee are no laws of nature, only socially constucted and self-referential systems, it is about making models taht helps people get insigh into their own understanding of the world, and we constantly replace the models as we get better and bette insights. A good model is one that you throw out as fast as possible.  

* Semantic web
- One of the many ways to encode knowledge, very useful bu 99.999% of humans do not get it, and is thus "useless" in social pocesses.

* Agents
  - how do you know which basic rules to give to them
    or which space of rules
  - You can never know what is the right set of rules, given the incosistency problem of social sciences, and, since we are mainly concened in representing the stakeholders beliefs about the world, the hey is, are the rules recogniseable to them?
  - "Hey, if you believe the social world works like this, and given the physical models of reality that the social system is interacting with, what are possibel futures? " Ah, you dont like how possibilities look like, ok, which part of decision making do we need to look into moe closely?  

* How do you know what to include
  - perspectives
  - resources
  - rules
  - "Model a problem, not a system" and "All models are wrong, some ae useful.
  - You do not know for sure, as all of this is negotiated knowledge in the participatoy prorcess. The goal is to make a "least wong, most useful model" fo the poblem at hand, which is understandeable and acceptable by the stakeholder.

* What kinds of rules and formlisms?
  - if-then-else?
  - state machines?
  - linear equations?
  - what else? DGLs?
  - All oof thse, + bayesien belif networks, MCDA, optimizations, anything that makes sense to the stakehodele that you are modelling.
  
* Def of intractability: 
  - can't "jump" into the future, you have to go there  
  
* Simulation
  - then look at patterns.  
  - how do you know when to stop running it?
  - sensitivity analysis, parameter variation
  - Uncertainty is king: Not just paametric uncetainty, but also deep structual uncertainty. What is the right model of the individual? What is the effect of alternative narratives about the world? This is a great way to remove a vey important isk in social processes : we don not have to agree on who is right, we just test both plausible naratives. See http://simulation.tbm.tudelft.nl/ema-workbench/contents.html

* How do you know a simulation is
  - correct -> obsessive verification !
  - reliable/trustworthy to X% - Yo dont, becasue it is not.
  - is there any notion of "proof"? - The goal of modelling is insight, not numbers. In socio-technical domain models ae are impactful/useful  are self-invalidating. 
  - Very often it is the modelling process that brigs the greratest value.
  - Problem of the unknown unknowns -> these you can not solve with modelling, but through deliberation about reality, using models.

 
* What is milti-modeling?
- Technical model + social models. Each model is a speciffic cimplification of reality, based on aspeciffic language. If we are to capture complexity, then Ashby's aw of requisite vaety must be respected, and we need a multitude of models, from various perspectives.
- Separation of concerns, reuse of model building blocks.
- notion of mulit-model ecologies.

* Examples. 
  - CO2 trading
  - why specifically the energy sector as an area of focus?
  - what else are examples of successful use?
  - how do you define success of one of your projects?

Part 3: Insights
-----------

* Insights: how do you grow a sustainable socio-technical system
- you take an explicit normative stance
- try to collect evidence and  model / explore the impacts of your desired actiopns to try avoid the onbvious and not so obious stpid actions
and than just do it.

* Bottom up 
  - how do you define the "botton up" rules?
  - "emergence endineering" Satisficing, and not optimising. 
  - 

* Fail gracefully  
  - meaning? many small experiments?
  - vs. resilience?

* Grow 
  - step by step
  - it might become sustainable, but slow?
  
* Together
  - ?

* What does this mean for collective rule making in governments? 
  - where we try to centralize some decisions?
  - are those systems too complex to be "governed"?
  - should we simplify?
  - Relationship to Tainter

* Is evolution a little bit like machine learning? 
  In the sense that even though it is supposed to be 
  neutral and objective it depends on the rules 
  (data) we use for evolving (learning)?
  - NN are a simplified abstraction about how brain mihgt work. GA's ae explicit and  simplified models  of evolutionary pocesses.
  - ML is patten maching, evolution is patten generation, so two sides of the same coin.
  - you can think of NNs as a universes way to understand itself

* Relationship to technikfolgenabschätzung?
