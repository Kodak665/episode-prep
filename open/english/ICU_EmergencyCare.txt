1. Introduction Kimon L.H. Ioannides and Junad Chowdhury

2. Emergency care
  * What is emergency care? Everyone who comes to the hospital by ambulance or helicopter? 
    Things like strokes as well as accidents? 
    All ages or is there a specific emergency care for children? 
  * If a patient already is hospitalised and then gets bad suddenly, will he/she also be 
        treated by emergency care?
  * Is the only goal of emergency care to stabilize the patient and then transfer him/her 
    to another part of the hospital?
  * How do you deal with shock?
  * What is the standard procedure that you use if somebody arrives at the emergency room 
    to find out how acute the situation is?
  * Does it happen often that somebody arrives at the emergency room and "looks" good, 
    but if fact is in a very bad condition? Or the other way round?
  * As I understand, emergency care relies heavily on blood donors - what is the typical 
    way from donor to care, and what else can be donated this way and what for?
    
3. Intensive care
  * What is intensive care? Which patients typically go to ICU? 
    (Accidents/after big surgeries/failure of circulation/bad breathlessness/pneumonia)
    What is the minimum of automated monitoring a patient will have in intensive care? 
    Breathing and circulation? Also brain function?
    Which percentage of patients will be on ventilation?
  * How are patients fed in intensive care?
   
4. Infectious diseases in emergency and intensive care
  * If somebody comes into emergency room what will make the doctors alert that it could 
    be an infectous disease?
  * Which precautions are taken? Are there any standard tests that are done on everybody 
    to prevent that infections introduced in the hospital?
    
5. Ventilation
     * What kinds of ventilation are done?
     * Is mechanical ventilation done with normal air? With a higher portion of oxygen?
     * When is mechanical ventilation necessary? When the muscles are not strong enough 
      to move compress the lungs?
     * Ventilation only makes sense if the lungs can still transfer the oxygen into the 
       blood. If this is not possible any more, the blood must be enriched with oxygen 
       outside the body, right?
     * How can the patient come out of ventilation again? Do the lungs start to works by 
       themselves automically again?
     * Maybe more in general, how ventilators compare to other breathing apparatus. For 
       example oxygen concentrators, or the equipment you get in aircraft.
     * What is the long-term impact of being ventilated? What damage is done to the lungs?
     * what about projects like https://corovent.com? is having a cheap purpose built 
       ventilator the key to our current situation or are cases where covid gets to a 
       ventilator stage already highly fatal, so the impact isn't that high?
     * Is it possible to build DIY-ventilators with stuff like Arduino or is it just 
       a dangerous nerd-dream ignoring the complexity involved
     * What is the difference between a ventilator and a bpap / cpap?
