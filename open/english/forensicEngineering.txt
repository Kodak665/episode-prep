* Introduction Sean
  "I can’t talk about any of the investigations I have personally undertaken 
    because they are legally confidential"

* Context: mostly civil engineering

------- CAUSES -------------

* Structural Engineering. 
  - art & science of molding Materials we do not fully understand; into Shapes we cannot
	precisely analyze; to resist Forces we cannot accurately predict; all in
	such a way that the society at large is given no reason to suspect the
	extent of our ignorance.’
  - Sure it should be stable ...
  - ... but which other constraints apply? 
    . look nice
    . cheap

* The role of design, simulation, prototyping, experience, "stories"
  - what are the safety factors/margins
  - what are the validatioon processes
  - no real opportunity for prototypes and testing. 
    ... but there are material/strength experiments, right?

* Seven Types of Structural Failure
  - Operations (maintenance) errors 
  - Design errors
  - Construction errors
  - Material deficiencies
  - Programming deficiencies
  - Site selection and site development errors
  - Fundamental errors in concept
    "requirements errors", wrong load assumptions
    
* Material specifics
  - Steel
  - Concrete

* Bridges seem to be special: dynamic loads. 
  - other special aspects?
  - majority of failures are caused by external factors, 
    e.g., flood, scour, overloading, impact.

* What are typical design errors?

* What are typical construction errors?
  - Using the materials wrongly?
  - How is the "correct" use (from plan to building)
    guaranteed/checked? 
    - And is this relative to the criticality?
    - where are more causes? design or construction?


* How do you make a distinction between a genuine fate-related,
  bad-luck failure, and avoidable (careless) human or process error?
  - Like: completely new, unknown effects (Unknown Unknowns), 
    . eg dynamic wind effects
  - Is it always a clear distinction?
  - You can always ultimately blame everything on humans, obviously.
    ("autopilot failed, yes, but the pilots should have been able to cope bla bla")
    . Is the process wrong
    . or do we make mistakes in the process. 
  
* What are the causes of human mistakes?
  - Anti-Authority: The rules don’t apply to me or to my special situation
  - Impulsiveness: Hurry up! Let’s get it over with!
  - Macho: Let me show you how the big boys work
  - Invulnerability: Only bad, stupid, or unlucky people make errors
  - Resignation: It doesn’t matter what I do

  -> what about genuine errors? Unknown unknowns.
  -> what about being "blinded" by expertise?
  -> "trusting the computer"
  -> Organizational forgetfulness?
     does this relate to the 30 year cycle?
  
* "Most failures occur due to trivial mistakes, generally lost in 
  the details, and often related to ‘boring’ tasks, e.g., dead load 
  gets calculated incorrectly, designers miss mistakes in drawings."
  - so is this a process or tool issue?
  - or basically unavoidable?  
    Sean:   "Human error is unavoidable"
    Markus: "I disagree" :-)

  
    
* Do computers/automation help, or introduce new/other risks?  
  - produce too much confidence
  
* Doesn't the NASA examples show that even highly structured, 
  regulated and professional orgs make mistakes? 
  - Near miss theory 
  - Have we already over-complexified the process? 
    . or over-complexified the buildings?
    . How do you build the "meta process" that keeps the process sane?
  - Key question: 
    Is the way that we set up the contractual framework for construction 
    projects part of the problem. A key concept in failure prevention 
    is don’t assign risk to a party that cant manage it. Yet legal 
    contracts do this all the time in construction projects
  - is something wrong with the "professional ethics"?
  - At what point do we simply collide with human nature?
  
* What can we do?
  - We can't just increase safety factors because of weight, cost, etc.
  - is there a certain level of problems that cannot be avoided?
  - swiss cheese model, i35w
  - is the current level "societally ok", so we don't have to improve
    (compare ppl dying from car accidents)

  
* Key things you can do in terms of failure prevention are not technical in nature.
  - communication
  - collaboration
  - risk allocation
  - control mechanisms. 
  -> if we manage these human factors we will manage the  technical causes of failure.
  Markus: I am not sure. it just says that we have good tech, and now the
  human is "bottleneck". And we can't make the process perfect, b/c we collide
  with human nature.

------- FINDING OUT -------------

* Regular vs. Forensic Engineering
  - By which rules do regular engineers work (standards, etc)
  - How is FE different?

* Activities
  - Preliminary investigation
  - Evidence collection 
  - Litigation support
  - Arbitration support
  - Expert witness services

* Why not the regular engineer
  - jump to recommendations
  - assumptions vs. actual loads
    "collect and interpret physical evidence and instead relies on assumptions, 
    there is a risk these assumptions may be called into question in the face of 
    evidence."
  - wider range of failure hypotheses

* Walk us through an investigation
  - how long does FE take
  - collab w other agencies?
 
* Tools used by the FE
  - look at evidence
  - form hypo
  - experiments?
  
* How do you "proof"? Matter of statistics?

* Not many accidents seem to happen
  - are you busy :-) ?
  - What are the general, long-term trends? Are we making progress?
