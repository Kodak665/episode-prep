HEATHROW
--------------------------------------------
* Heathrow from an ATC perspective
  - busy!
  - airspace size
  - common airspace with other London airports?
  - coordination with other airspaces / ATC centers
  - "stations" (arrival, departure, delivery, tower, ground/apron ...)
    . quick run through how these interact
  
* Major challenges:
  - enhancing the capacity of the airport
  - reducing hold times?
  - keep capacity with declining weather?
  ... while maintaining safety

* What are capacity constraints
  - one a/c on rwy
  - number of rwys
  - separation/vortexes 
  - ?

* What to do
  - introduction of Time Based Separation on approach (currently the only airport in the world using this concept and tool) 
  - Re-categorisation of wake turbulence classifications
  - Advanced airport safety nets 
  - Automatic routeing and guidance of aircraft on the ground
  - Departure Separation tool
  - Flow Control/slot times
  - Airport Collaborate Decision Making
  Each:    
  . idea, insight
  . realization
  . tool support / procedure changes?
  . regulatory impact?
  . requirements on a/c and crew (enablers)
  . successful? capacity increase?
