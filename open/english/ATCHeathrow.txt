It’s probably my poor descriptions of my job! I don’t actually design approaches (as in what are on Jeppesen plates, etc), but write ATC procedures, so the contents of our ATC ops Manuals. 

However, some of the projects I’ve been involved in over the years your listeners might find interesting...
- introduction of Time Based Separation on approach (currently the only airport in the world using this concept and tool) 
- Re-categorisation of wake turbulence classifications
- Advanced airport safety nets 
- Automatic routeing and guidance of aircraft on the ground
- Departure Separation tool
- Flow Control/slot times
- Airport Collaborate Decision Making
