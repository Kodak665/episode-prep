f18 is a very good aircraft. Handles well, natural feel, doesn’t bite
the pilot when mishandled. Massive envelope. It’s always interesting
hearing comparisons with F16. Very very different.

* A little bit of F-18 history
  - YF-17
  - F-18
  
* What makes it a (good) carrier airplane
  - hook
  - strong gear
  - slow approach speed
  - 2 engines (F-35 first Navy airplane with 1 engine?)
  
* Flight Characteristics
  - High AoA 
    . operationally useful
  - Power2Weight ratio? Not quite like F-15 or 16, right?
  - Not enough fuel
  - Could your grandma land it?
  
* Radar features	
  Ground Mapping
  
* The ladder ... could you lower it from the cockpit?  
  
* Nav Systems
  GPS?
  
* Plastic airplane ... did you ever lose something?  
  
* Missions
  - A2G
  - A2G
  - Like F-16, a classic Multi Role 
  
* Let's walk through a carrier landing
  - in the Barrel

* Cockpit
  - How long to get HOTAS
  - how quickly would you forget the not-so-often-used features?
  - Task saturation from upfront panel, radar, formatrion


* Blues
  - modifications (spring!)
  - how do you learn to be a Blue Angel
  - Flying vs. "Show"
  - Competition with the USAF
  
  
* Thank Nick
