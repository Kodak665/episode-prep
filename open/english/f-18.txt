f18 is a very good aircraft. Handles well, natural feel, doesn’t bite
the pilot when mishandled. Massive envelope. It’s always interesting
hearing comparisons with F16. Very very different.

* A little bit of F-18 history
  - YF-17
  - F-18
  - who uses it AUS/CAN/FIN/CH/SPAIN/KUWAIT/MALAYS
  
* mission a2a and a2g 
  did you fly both?
  which squadrons?
  
redesign e/f
weights
fbw
geometry LEX wing fold

range problem
slats and flaps
harv up to 65 deg

service entry 1978
marines just retired now.

where were you stationed? carrier tours?
A/C differences?
Weapons


  
  
* What makes it a (good) carrier airplane
  - hook
  - strong gear
  - slow approach speed
  - 2 engines (F-35 first Navy airplane with 1 engine?)
  
* Flight Characteristics
  - High AoA 
    . operationally useful
  - Power2Weight ratio? Not quite like F-15 or 16, right?
  - Not enough fuel
  - Could your grandma land it?
  
* Radar features	
  Ground Mapping
  
* The ladder ... could you lower it from the cockpit?  
  
* Nav Systems
  GPS?
  
* Plastic airplane ... did you ever lose something?  
  
* Missions
  - A2G
  - A2G
  - Like F-16, a classic Multi Role 
  
* Let's walk through a carrier landing
  - in the Barrel

* Cockpit
  - How long to get HOTAS
  - how quickly would you forget the not-so-often-used features?
  - Task saturation from upfront panel, radar, formatrion


* Blues
  - modifications (spring!)
  - how do you learn to be a Blue Angel
  - Flying vs. "Show"
  - Competition with the USAF
  - left wingman
  - slot
  
  strong landing gear
  does the a/c have a "key"
  landing is just a crash - no flare
  
launch hands off - how much automation?
how is taxiing on the carrier?

night cat.
night landing.

interaction with LSO
aoproach via aoa instead of speed

how was the hornet on the ball
8.1 aoa. Maintenance Subpage. 3250 trim. 

carrier landing training

ECM

Gun, Smoke tank.
What is the smoke oil?
how do you activate the smoke?
Radar APG 65
A2G mapping mode. position target relative to ground building/bridge.
Surface search. 

fixed intakes.
tie downs on gear.
hard points.
weapons
flir pod
Helmet mounted cueing system (in the EF, not the C, right?)
wing fold
ailerons? diff elevators?
dynamically unstable?
"mech mode" fbw

NVGs
weekly program at the blues

rate fight vs. radius fight
hornet benefit to fly slow - but isn't it risky to go to low energy? re-accelerate?

35 aoa possible - but what to do with that taxitally

reminds me of finnish f18 demo at 2019 air tattoo

role of fuel dump on landing

engines
> 1:1 t/w

where exactly does the smoke oil hit the engine?
how is the pipe laid from the gun in the nose?

  
  
  
blues:
flying is hard
mental aspect
pacing
show / rock star
how to adapt to new show site
impact of wind, elevation
why primarily left turns
challenge of number 3 position?

slot pilot.
Also Trainign officer. How do you go about at El Centro?
Role of Safety officer in flight:

What is different/harder: solos or diamond?
"prison cell" 

who does a better show? TBirds or Blues?

how to do precision formation stuff
checkpoints on the airplane
Flying paint
Lex fence underneath "hornet"
  cut off via wing -> gives a line.
  and then follow "out" until nose aligned with nozzles
  and the step in slowly.

yellow lex bolt for 360
really really close!
so do you ever "trade paint"?

how much tighter is the formation towards the end of the season?

aoa: b/c lex vortexes hit rudder so you retain authority

built-in ladder

blues structurally similar to thunderbirds - diff?
automatic landing f-18

Max usable real world aoa and influence of height, weight and configuration on it.

rather short final
