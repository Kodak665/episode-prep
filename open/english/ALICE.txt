Two basic perspectives
1) The science: what does ALICE do, how does this fit
   with the standard model, and which "new science"  
   are we hoping to find.
2) How does the detector actually work. 
I would like to talk about the first aspect relatively
briefly (max. 30 minutes, maybe even before we enter
ALICE) and then focus mostly on the second perspective.

1 The Science
---------------------------------------------------

* Quark Gluon Plasma
* How is this interesting? Rel to Big Bang
* Quantum Chromodynamics
* Ultrarelativistic collisions
* phase transition
* Lead Proton Collisions
  - Lead ions are accelerated to more than 99.9999% of the speed of light 
  - and collisions at the LHC are 100 times more energetic than those of protons
* temperature almost 100,000 times higher than the temperature in the core of the sun.

 The collaboration has been making major inroads into the understanding of the dynamics of the QGP – a state of matter that prevailed in the first instants of the universe and is recreated in droplets at the LHC.

2 Overview ALICE
-----------------------------------------------------

* The ALICE experiment
  - LHC vs. Experiments
  - Size/Weight Detector
  - Construction History
  - Size/Structure of the ALICE collaboration


* What does it do?
  - "relies on being able to identify all of them, i.e. to determine if they
     are electrons, photons, pions, etc. and to determine their charge"
  - What kinds of particles?
  - How many particles can be recorded
  - What is being recorded about each of them?
  - How much "realtime" is necessary?

* characteristic signatures they leave in the detector.



3 Detector subsystems
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Subsystems / Detector Layers
  - first a tracking system
  - then an electromagnetic (EM) 
  - adronic calorimeter
  - a muon system.
  
* Embedded in Mag Field .5 Tesla produced by a huge magnetic solenoid bending 
  - Momentum
  - Charge
  
* But: not suitable for hadron identification as it doesn't allow
distinguishing the different charged hadrons that are produced in Pb-Pb
collisions.

EACH: 
 - What do they record
 - How do they do it
 - How does it fit into the big picture

* Barrel Tracking
  - Inner Tracking System
    . Silicon Pixel Detector(SPD)
    . Silicon Drift Detector(SDD)
    . Silicon Strip Detector(SSD)
  - Time Projection Chamber(TPC)
    . large volume filled with a gas as detection medium
    . ionize the gas atoms along their path
    . how is the track recorded?
  - Transition Radiation Detector(TRD)

* Particle Identification
  - "identified if their mass and charge are determined"
  - Time of Flight
  - High Momentum Particle Identification Detector
  - Calorimeters
    . Photon spectrometer
    . Electro-Magnetic Calorimeter
    . Photon Multiplicity Detector
    . Forward Multiplicity Detector
    . Muon spectrometer
  
* Characterization of the collision
  - Zero Degree Calorimeter
  - V0 detector
  - T0 detector


"eavy quarks (charm and beauty) can be identified by reconstructing the
coordinates at which they decay." (b/c positon is time)
 
  
* Precision? 
  - What level?
  - Which dimensions? Position?
    "fraction of a mill"
  - Why is this necessary?


* Data Processing / Computing
  - detector readout
  - event building
  - data recording
  - detector calibration
  - data reconstruction
  - physics simulation 
  - analysis.       

* The role of statistics: many experiements to resolve the data


4 What is currently being updated?
----------------------------------------------------------
* How does it exploit the high luminosity?

* Detector upgrades
  - Inner Tracking System 
    . new all-pixel silicon inner tracker based on CMOS monolithic active pixel sensor (MAPS) technology 
      accumulate 10 times more integrated luminosity
   . The ITS consists of seven cylindrical layers of ALPIDE chips, 
     summing up to 12.5 billion pixels and a total area of 10 m2
  - MFT 
    . The new MFT detector is designed to add vertexing capabilities to the muon 
      spectrometer and will enable a number of new measurements that are currently beyond reach
    . The MFT consists of five disks, each composed of two MAPS detection planes, 
      placed perpendicular to the beam axis between the IP and the hadron absorber 
      of the muon spectrometer.
  - TPC
    . main device for tracking and charged-particle identification in ALICE. 
    . new readout chambers employing a novel configuration of stacks of four GEMs 
      have been developed during an extensive R&D programme
  - FIT
    . comprises two arrays of Cherenkov radiators with MCP–PMT sensors and a 
      single, large-size scintillator ring. The arrays will be placed on both 
      sides of the IP. 
    
* The newly designed ALICE readout system presents a change in approach, as all 
  lead–lead collisions that are produced in the accelerator, at a rate of 50 kHz, 
  will be read out in a continuous stream. 
    
* The significantly improved ALICE detector will allow the collaboration to collect 
  100 times more events during LHC Run 3 compared to Run 1 and Run 2, which requires 
  the development and implementation of a completely new readout and computing system. 

* New data processing / computing system
