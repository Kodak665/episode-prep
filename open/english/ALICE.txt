	Two basic perspectives
1) The science: what does ALICE do, how does this fit
   with the standard model, and which "new science"  
   are we hoping to find.
2) How does the detector actually work. 
I would like to talk about the first aspect relatively
briefly (max. 30 minutes, maybe even before we enter
ALICE) and then focus mostly on the second perspective.

* Quark Gluon Plasma
* How is this interesting? Rel to Big Bang
* Quantum Chromodynamics
* ultrarelativistic collisions
* phase transition
* Lead ions are accelerated to more than 99.9999% of the speed of light and collisions at the LHC are 100 times more energetic than those of protons
* temperature almost 100,000 times higher than the temperature in the core of the sun.
* Lead Proton Collisions

2

* LHC vs. Experiments
* Construction History
* Size/Weight Detector
* Size of the ALICE org

"relies on being able to identify all of them, i.e. to determine if they
are electrons, photons, pions, etc. and to determine their charge"

* What kinds of particles?
* How many particles can be recorded
* What is being recorded about each of them?
* How much "realtime" is necessary?

* characteristic signatures they leave in the detector.

* Subsystems / Detector Layers
  - first a tracking system
  - then an electromagnetic (EM) 
  - adronic calorimeter
  - a muon system.
  
* Embedded in Mag Field .5 Tesla produced by a huge magnetic solenoid bending 
  - Momentum
  - Charge
  
* But: not suitable for hadron identification as it doesn't allow
distinguishing the different charged hadrons that are produced in Pb-Pb
collisions.

* Inner Tracking System
  - Silicon Pixel Detector(SPD)
  - Silicon Drift Detector(SDD)
  - Silicon Strip Detector(SSD)
  - Time Projection Chamber(TPC)
  - Transition Radiation Detector(TRD) 
  
"eavy quarks (charm and beauty) can be identified by reconstructing the
coordinates at which they decay." (b/c positon is time)
  
* Precision? 
  - What level?
  - Which dimensions? Position?
    "fraction of a mill"
  - Why is this necessary?

* What is being done during the current upgrade?

* The role of statistics: many experiements to resolve the data
