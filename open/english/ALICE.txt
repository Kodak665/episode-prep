Two basic perspectives
1) The science: what does ALICE do, how does this fit
   with the standard model, and which "new science"  
   are we hoping to find.
2) How does the detector actually work. 
I would like to talk about the first aspect relatively
briefly (max. 30 minutes, maybe even before we enter
ALICE) and then focus mostly on the second perspective.
