Current Situation and Recap
---------------------------------------------------

* Brief recap how a nuclear power plant works
  - fission creates excess energy -> heat
  - heat exchanger to secondary cycle -> steam
  - steam -> turbine -> generator
  - engineering challenges include
    . control of fission rate / moderation / control rods
    . cooling
    . how to safely shut the thing down and cool remaining heat after shutdown
    . waste and proliferation

* Recap of the currently most-used reactor types
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_II_reactor
  - pressurized water reactor (siedewasser/druckwasser)
  
Newer Designs
----------------------------------------------------  
* why are we talking: newer designs are (designed to be)
  - less (or shorter lived) waste
  - more efficient
  - easier/self shutdown
  - less technically complex
  
* Generation IV
  - recap of older generations and their distinction
  - GIF
    . who is behind this?
    . which countries perform active research and engineering?

* Which parameters are varied with newer designs?
  - Neutron Spectrum (Thermal / Fast)
  - Coolant	
    . normally water
    . using metallic sodium as a coolant. 
    . Supercritical-water-cooled reactor
  - Temperature
    . more efficient through higher temp: why?
  - Fuel (Material, Shape, Cycle)
    . pebble bed
    . molten salt
    . Waste burner
    . Breeding; what is this?
  - Power
    . small modular reactors
    . How small can they get, sensibly?
    . On a truck, backyard

* Talk about a few example designs
  - Very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR)
  - Molten-salt reactor (MSR)
  - Supercritical-water-cooled reactor (SCWR)
  - Gas-cooled fast reactor (GFR)
  - Sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR)
  - Lead-cooled fast reactor (LFR)

* How/why are they safer?
  - still have very high pressures that might "explode"
  - or salt that will react with water 
  - passive safety
    Emergency Draining System designed for the MSFR
  - negative temperature coefficient
  - negative void coefficients
  - lower fissile inventory
  - no initial criticality reserve
  - simplified fuel cycle
  - can we also manage / understand them better? Eg,
    measure neutron flux in the core
  - wouldn't overall safety be higher if we continued to improve
    existing reactor designs (because we know more about them)

* What specifically was learned from Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, or Fukushima 
  - are improvements needed to the core process,
  - or to the control systems, "user interface" and training of staff?

* What is the current state of development of these?
  - I read a lot about cancellations ...
  
* Other Initiatives beyond GIF
  - small nuclear power plant in your backyard
  - Your research, the offshore floating nuclear power plant

The role of fission in the future energy mix
--------------------------------------------------------
* IMHO we can't rely on renewables and "change of lifestyle"
  large-scale reduction of energy use (and potentially (perceived) quality of life) is
  very hard to achieve, see Corona experience. Threatens democracy in the worst case.

* What about the politcal feasibility? 
  - Are people still willing to "buy into" them or is the image destroyed?
  - Different in different countries I guess

* are these new reactors economically feasible 
  - *without* the implicit subsidies we have (had) for fission so far?
  - in competition with renewables?
  - How accessible will the technology be for developing countries?

* final storage problem is less
  - but still there
  - tear down, activated material

* proliferation?

* Should we rather invest in (and wait for) fusion?
* Let's say we replace all fossile plants with nuclear ones, how long would the fuel last?
* what about your perspective on catastrophic risks? 
  - Also in comparison to deaths from bad coal air or climate change?
  - what is the bound of the safety analysis. 
    . The reactor itself (Chernobyl), 
    . the surrounding and nature (Tsunami, Fuku), 
    . the operating teams
    . the whole world ....
  
Your research
--------------------------  
* What are you working on in terms of research? 
  - Nuclear Batteries
  - Boiling, heat transfer and Nanofluids
